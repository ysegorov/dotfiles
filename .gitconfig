# When creating a new branch off a remote branch, always set it up to
# track the remote branch so that we can pull from there.

[branch "master"]
# This is the list of cmdline options that should be added to git-merge
# when I merge commits into the master branch.
#
# First off, the option --no-commit instructs git not to commit the merge
# by default. This allows me to do some final adjustment to the commit log
# message before it gets commited. I often use this to add extra info to
# the merge message or rewrite my local branch names in the commit message
# to branch names sensible to the casual reader of the git log.
#
# Option --no-ff instructs git to always record a merge commit, even if
# the branch being merged into can be fast-forwarded. This is often the
# case when you create a short-lived topic branch which tracks master, do
# some changes on the topic branch and then merge the changes into the
# master which remained unchanged while you were doing your work on the
# topic branch. In this case the master branch can be fast-forwarded (that
# is the tip of the master branch can be updated to point to the tip of
# the topic branch) and this is what git does by default. With --no-ff
# option set git creates a real merge commit which records the fact that
# another branch was merged. I find this easier to understand and read in
# the log.
